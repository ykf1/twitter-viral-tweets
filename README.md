# twitter-viral-tweets

Can we predict if a tweet will go viral? Based on a dataset of tweets where we have various known information like retweet count, tweet length, followers and friends count, links count and other features, this project will aim to predict if a tweet will go viral (> 100 retweets) based on known features using machine learning models like logistic regression. Please refer to the jupyter notebook for the code and workflow.
